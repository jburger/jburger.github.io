I guess the pull to use markdown and github as a blogging platform was too great - [github pages](http://pages.github.com) have that elusive _it just works_ factor.

Originally, I had grand visions of making it a DIY project, but between working in the game and helping out on a startup, as well as keeping up with study on Azure and other tech, this was starting to feel like a fools errand. Blogging was more important than learning to use [angular 2](https://angular.io) & [nodejs to integrate with Github](https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-github).

I've tried [the](http://wordpresscom) [big](http://tumblr.com) [three](http://blogger.com). I've tried dasBlog. Yes I'm fussy - I want control, but I want it to be simple. I want it to have features (e.g. custom domain redirection), but I don't want to pay for those features. 
[Medium](https://medium.com) was tempting, but ultimately I guess I'm a little bit old fashioned. I _already have_ a versioning backing store in github. Why be untidy and spin up yet another?

I'll attempt to move my existing content from [The Maintenance Coder](http://maintenancecoder.wordpress.com) over the coming month. Will see how that pans out.
