I guess the pull to use markdown and github as a blogging platform was too great - [github pages](http://pages.github.com) have that elusive _it just works_ factor.

Originally, I had grand visions of making it a DIY project, but between working in the game and helping out on a startup, as well as keeping up with study on Azure and other tech, this was starting to feel like a fools errand. Blogging was more important than learning to use [angular 2](https://angular.io) & [nodejs to integrate with Github](https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-github).

I have been continually disappointed with the major blog platforms for quite some time after having tried the big three. I started blogging using a hosted dasBlog instance many iterations ago, and this just feels more like the good old days. Yes I'm aware that dates me - although not as badly as my love of vim.

[Medium](https://medium.com) was tempting, but ultimately I guess I'm a little bit old fashioned. I _already have_ a versioning backing store in github. Why be untidy and spin up yet another?

I'll attempt to move my existing content from [The Maintenance Coder](maintenancecoder.wordpress.com) over the coming month. Will see how that pans out.
