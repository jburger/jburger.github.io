<p>In a <a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2009/12/27/i-still-dont-get-f/">short rant</a>, Roger declares that he doesn't "get" F#. There is no business case, no ROI, what can't I do in C# that is in F#. Etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that Microsoft are trying to sell F# to us as something new and awesome, but I’m having serious problems seeing the benefits over C#.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roger wants us to prove to him that we actually all need F#. Well Roger, you are right, you probably don't need F#.</p>
<p>It can be hard to see the benefits over C#. If you aren't excited about new ways to tackle the concurrency problem, or new approaches to handling generic and mathematical problems, and if the thought of breaking out the shiny new lexer and parser don't give you a tingle, then maybe F# <em>isn't actually marketed at you at all.</em> Perhaps, just maybe, its for a group of programmers that are gagging to get their hands on a managed language to break new ground in their medical, pharmaceutical, mathematical and scientific fields - on Windows.</p>
<p>Heres a newsflash, <strong>not everybody is writing e-commerce applications.</strong></p>
<p>The thing is, people who earn a living in these  alternative problem spaces typically use functional languages like Erlang, OCaml, Clojure, Scheme, Common Lisp and so on. The market (apparently) <em>is there,</em> and while some of them still love to use vim, many would like a decent IDE - and at the moment, that IDE is called Eclipse. What Microsoft is aiming for is to take a chunk out of the almost exclusive monopoly that the Java platform has on this segment of the developer population. <em>We don't have to get it</em>, any more than they don't have to get Visual Basic.</p>
<p>But back to Rogers rant, apparently, this is how these guys and gals should do currying, something they are used to in most functional languages:</p>

```csharp
string Foo(int a,bool b)
{
   //do stuff
}
void UseCurry()
{
    Func curriedFooWithTrue = a => Foo(a,true);
    //invoke curried function.
    var res = curriedFooWithTrue(123);
}
```


<p>This apparently, is pipelining:</p>

``` csharp
var listOfInts = new List {1,2,3,4,5,6};
Func<int,int> squared = x => x*x;
var squaredListOfInts = listOfInts.Select(x => squared).ToList();
```

</p>
<p>While sure, C# can do that - <strong>why would you?</strong> As soon as we want to use pipelining and currying <em>to increase the expressiveness of our code,</em> not just to use it for the sake of using it, we can start to write some fantastic internal DSLs.</p>

```fsharp
let should test actual =
  test actual
let equal expected actual =
  if expected <> actual then
    failwith "Expected values to be equal"
//usage
let sayHello name = "Hello " + name
  sayHello "Roger" |> should equal "Hello Roger"
```

<p>Note that is a generic solution. The F# compiler also figured out that the generic function equal, will only work if its arguments are actually equatable. The generic type inference, complete with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233203%28VS.100%29.aspx">generic constraints far more powerful than in C#</a><em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233203%28VS.100%29.aspx"> </a>is just sublime</em>. Pipelining works in two directions, not just left to right.</p>
<p>So to continue, apparently <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd268536%28VS.100%29.aspx">tuples </a>are like meh..</p>
<p>...but F# uses them for things like grouping:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="fsharp"]</p>
<p>type Person =<br />
 {<br />
    Name: string;<br />
    Address: string;<br />
    PostCode: string;<br />
 }</p>
<p>let testData =<br />
  Seq.init 10 (fun i -&gt;<br />
  {<br />
    Name = &quot;Name&quot; + i.ToString();<br />
    Address = &quot;Address&quot; + i.ToString();<br />
    PostCode = &quot;000&quot; + (i % 2).ToString();<br />
  })</p>
<p>let frequencyByPostCode =<br />
  testData<br />
    |&gt; Seq.groupBy (fun person -&gt; person.PostCode) //seq&lt;Tuple&lt;string, Person&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
    |&gt; Seq.map (fun group -&gt;<br />
        match group with<br />
        | (pcode, people) -&gt; printfn &quot;%s - %d&quot; pcode (people.Count())<br />
       )<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>And before we start to moan that we could just use linq, this functionality existed before use of linq was actually possible.</p>
<p>So lets pretend for a moment, that if we were all sitting at PDC 2012 when the next release of C# comes out and there is the feature list in all its glory:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension">list comprehension</a></li>
<li>language keywords to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension">asynchronous programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/matthew.podwysocki/archive/2008/09/10/object-oriented-f-extension-everything.aspx">extension everything</a></li>
<li>less curly braces, angle brackets and semi colons (my favourite)</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233180%28VS.100%29.aspx">Generic type inference</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fortysix-and-two.blogspot.com/2009/06/traversing-and-transforming-f.html">operators to support the generation and substitution of Expressions</a></li>
<li>first class functions and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/matthew.podwysocki/archive/2009/10/19/f-october-2009-ctp-beta2-f-rx-together-at-last.aspx">events</a></li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233204%28VS.100%29.aspx">operator creation</a></li>
<li><a href="F# pattern matching">pattern matching</a></li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233248%28VS.100%29.aspx">Active patterns</a></li>
<li><a href="http://langexplr.blogspot.com/2008/10/using-f-computation-expressions-to-read.html">Computation expressions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure the blogosphere would be a light saying things like, "wow!", "cool!" and "look at all the new edge case programming problems we can solve in under two lines of code!". Some of us would like, do we need all that? Just like when Linq and Lambdas came to town.</p>
<p>To sum up, yes <em>there is </em>a business case for F#, just not in the classic sense. Will you write your next LOB app in it? That would probably be masochistic, and I would recommend against it. Will it make you money? Jury's still out, there are <a href="http://www.intellifactory.com/">successes</a> that indicate it can be done.</p>

UPDATE: Fast forward to 2016 and I think it is now clear that F# **is** a viable language, great for all kinds of applications -  and even for [LOB SAAS applications](http://fsharpshow.com/3-jet-revolutionizing-ecommerce-using-fsharp/).
