<p>Today I wanted to do a 'treeclean', i.e. remove all un-versioned files from my working copy of a source controlled project. I've been using<a href="http://www.sliksvn.com/"> SlikSVN</a>'s <a href="http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download">command line tools</a> for managing SVN stuff. However, there are some things a GUI client will do for you OOTB, and a treeclean is generally one of them.</p>
<p>Rather than installing a GUI tool just for this 'once in a blue moon' functionality -- I ran with what I had;Â powershell, slik &amp; regex:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="powershell"]<br />
#shorthand<br />
(svn st &quot;--no-ignore&quot;) -match '^[I?]' -replace '^.s+','' | rm -fo]<br />
#longhand<br />
(svn status &quot;--no-ignore&quot;) -match '^[I?]' -replace '^.s+','' | Remove-Item -Force<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Optionally, you could set the recurse option to rm if you were confident to do so.</p>
