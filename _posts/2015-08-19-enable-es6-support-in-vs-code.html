<p>I've recently been playing with <a href="http://koajs.com">koa.js</a> - which happens to lean on ES6 features quite heavily. Also using this as an opportunity to learn to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>. Loving both tools incidentally.</p>
<p>Code supports ES6 nicely, however you do need to configure your working directory to tell the IDE that you want to use it. Just add a jsconfig.json file to your directory root and add the following:</p>
<pre>
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>While you are there you may want to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript#_javascript-projects-jsconfigjson">setup other features!</a></p>
