<p>Wanna play with node? Don't want to install an alpha version on your windows box? Dont want to create a Linux VM to play with the real stuff? Dont!</p>
<p>Instead... go here... http://cloud9ide.org/ get an account...create a project.... and create a &lt;awesome_node_appname_goes_here&gt;.js file.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;">Hello world</span></p>
<p>The basic nodejs hello world can be found on the nodejs.org website and only needs slight modification to get to work in the Cloud9 environment. Cloud9 will expose a specific port and url for you to test against, should you need it. To refer to these things in code, you need to use the process.env.C9_PORT constant for the port and use the 0.0.0.0 as the IP address of your server. This means the hello world code would look like this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="javascript"]</p>
<p>var http = require('http');<br />
http.createServer(function(res,req){<br />
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});<br />
  res.end('Hello Worldn');<br />
}).listen(process.env.C9_PORT, '0.0.0.0');</p>
<p>console.log('ready on: ' + process.env.C9_PORT);</p>
<p>[/sourcecode]</p>
<h3>NPM</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons that playing with node on windows is a little bit of a drag right now is that NPM, the 'community standard' package manager is a no-go at this point. Im certain this will change, but for now...Cloud9 will happily talk to npm. Lets use the console down the bottom of the IDE and type in:</p>
<pre>'npm install socket.io'</pre>
