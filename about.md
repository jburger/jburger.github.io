Welcome to my blog. Hopefully you gain something, however small, from reading this and other posts here. If you find something that you enjoy, disagree or downright dislike, then I'd encourage you to start a discussion either via comments or directly at [disqus](https://theburge.disqus.com).

I've been learning about computing since I was a kid, and the one thing I keep coming back to is that programming can be both simple and complex.

The hallmark of well architected code is something that both achieves the solution to a problem, be that business or otherwise, often complex and nuanced, but does so in a way that is apparent, transparent and immediately recognizable. This immediately translates into maintainability, and lower cost of ownership.

For me, this is an ideal to strive for, and while no code is perfect, I find joy where there is simplicity within complex ideas.

I'm a proud father of three, husband, musician and avid gamer, and I firmly believe that fun is a measure of success, as much as profit.
