today I started writing my first blog engine.

I decided to use two primary technologies for content delivery: markdown and git. There are some other examples out there that appear to do this, but I just wanted the learning experience of using some new languages and platforms, as well as become more familiar with git scripting and automation.

Im using azure PaaS for hosting duties and a github account for content storage. I'll be writing everything using typescript on nodejs and using angular2 on the frontend.

My primary text editor is vs code from my macbook pro, although I'm also using atom for its excellent markdown previewer.

I've going for a minimalistic style and at this stage Im not interested in making this bog engine skinnable, although I'll be sticking to pure bootstrap where possible so in theory it should be as simple as a bootstrap theme.

I hope that others gain something from me sharing this sourcecode, and all suggestions, comments and pullrequests welcome :)
