# Leveraging Azure authentication and authorization

To begin with, let me just state that I'm no infosec expert, and that this simply a series of steps I took to create an application boilerplate that I could reuse.

I'm primarily interested in developing for dotnet core 1.0 and I'll be writing this on my mac. I've been using dnx and dnvm quite a bit at work so I thought I would try following the [fairly comprehensive](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/tutorials/your-first-mac-aspnet.html) tutorial to get started.

#### Setting up authentication providers
#### Role based authorizations
#### Logging
#### Wrapping up
